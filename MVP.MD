### Linear Regression

I have been working with data scraped from Kayak. I was able to scrape a total of 1027 flights and 19 features of those flights. After eliminating duplicates I was left with a total of 738 flights to work with. Most of my time since gathering data has been cleaning data. I have most of my numerical features cleaned, however I still have a few to clean and I have yet to start working with dummies. 

I was able to gather a baseline linear regression model, however I still have some feature engineering to do in order to make a better model. 

This is my current model, with an R^^2 of 0.089

I plan to work on getting my dates into a true date format next so I am able to add a feature of 'days to trip' which I think will be useful in my future models. I also plan on watching the timeserries lecture tonight to see what models I can use to incorporate the duration of the trip which is a time serries. 


Below I have attached a visualization and the summary of my current model, as well as a pair plot with my values that are currently numerical.
