My husband and I like to travel, we last traveled just before COVID and want to use linear regression to help us decide where and when to take our next international trip. I will use Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape data and then build a linear regression model to help us decide the most affordable choice for our trip. 


##Data

Data will be gathered from the Kayak website using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. An individual sample of data will be one flight, and the features I plan to use are departure city (will limit to the three closest airports to me), arrival destination, date of travel, departure time, arrival time, total stops, additional information, airline, duration of trip, price of flight, and route (will help determine number of stops). My regression model will help me predict the price of flights. 

##MVP Goal

Scrape at least 1,000 data points with 10 features from Kayak and use that data to build a linear regression model that will predict the price of a flight based on the factors listed above. This Provide a visualization for the linear regression model
